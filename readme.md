Personal expense tracker that uses Google Sheets as database.

Note: This is a very custom/bespoke project, built for myself.

More documentation will follow.

### Local setup instructions:

- Clone repo and install project deps.
- Install Java SDK.
- Install Android Studio and add new device to use Android v30. (anything higher is not supported).

That's it. You should be able to run the project and dev-build apk for the simulator.
